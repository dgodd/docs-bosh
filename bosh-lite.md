title: BOSH Lite
---

[BOSH Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) is a pre-built [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box which includes the Director. It uses containers to emulate VMs which makes it an excellent choice for:

- General BOSH exploration without investing time and resources to configure an IaaS
- Development of releases (including BOSH itself)
- Testing releases locally or in CI

Follow the instructions in the project's [README](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite/tree/master/README.md) to install BOSH Lite.
