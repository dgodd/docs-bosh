title: Deploying

Once referenced stemcells and releases are uploaded to the Director and the deployment manifest is complete, a deployment can be formed on the Director. The CLI provides a single command to create and update deployments: `bosh deploy`. From the perspective of the Director, creation and update of the deployment happens through the same steps.

To let the CLI know that you are planning to operate on a specific deployment you must set the deployment:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deployment ~/workspace/my-deployment/manifest.yml

Deployment set to `/Users/pivotal/workspace/my-deployment/manifest.yml'
</pre>

From then on most commands the CLI provides act on the set deployment. To form a deployment on the Director represented by the `manifest.yml`, run the deploy command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh deploy
</pre>

After the deploy command completes with either success or failure you can run a command to list VMs created for this deployment:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh instances

Deployment `my-deployment'
